                <h2>Highlights</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is a 27 hour first person horror game where you can't kill the monster. Tension is high.</li>
                    <li>The AI adapts to your tactics.</li>
                    <li>The look and feel of the <em>Alien</em> franchise are captured perfectly</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Lowlights</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is 27 hours long. Very long for a horror game.</li>
                    <li>The story is servicable but nothing spectacular.</li>
                    <li>The AI rubberbanding to you is a bit annoy.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why I love this game</h2>
                <p>This is an extremely tense experience that had me too scared to play it alone at first. You are helpless. You are hunted and every tool you get to help your survival, comes at a cost.</p>
                <p>The click of your motion tracker will set it off it it is too close but is also your most valuable tool. Running is an option but you'll always be outspeed if you can't find shelter.</p>
                <p>Your flamethrower makes you feel invincible until the alien adapts and waits out the first burst before charging again.</p>
                <p>Overall: Its the perfect survival horror because you are pretty, scurrying about a dank station feeling the same primal fear out ancestors did; using all the tools at your disposal to live just a little longer.</p>
