        <h2>The Gist</h2>
        <p>The third entry in the Witcher video game series, based upon the book series of the same name. 
            The final outing of legendary witcher Geralt of Rivia embarks through a grim fantasy world where atrocity is commonplace, monsters are real, morality dubious, in search of his daughter. All the while seeking to evade the calamity that is the Wild Hunt.

            <h2>Why I love this game</h2>
            <p>Witcher 3 is the total package. It is beautiful, mature, and complex. It makes most standard fantasy look embarrassing by comparison.</p>
            <p>Combat is fun an engaging and whilst it has less of a learning curved than the second game, it is still challenging enough.</p>
            <p>The sidequests are also rewarding and well thought out, not just meticulous chores and though the main quest can lag at times, it is definately a high point of the game as well.</p>
            <p>You also get a lot of bang for your buck. The base game is huge with no shortage of thing to do. DLC adds even more and all of it very fairly priced.</p>
