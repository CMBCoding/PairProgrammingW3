                    <h2>Why we love this game</h2>
                    <p> Halo had perfectly balanced combat with satisfying shooting mechanics</p>
                    <p>You really felt like a super soldier trying to keep your team of marines alive.</p>
                    <p>Not only did this game have an engaging campaign, but it also had plenty of multiplayer maps and game modes that combined awesome vehicle physics with tight shooting controls</p>
                    <p>Overall: Its one of the most influential shooter games because it introduced aim assist mechanics to console making shooter games accessible to controller players while also pushing graphics and physics</p>
